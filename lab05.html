    <h2>Technical Understanding</h2>

    <h3>Dark Mode Feature</h3>
    <p>
        The dark mode works by using JavaScript to toggle a class called 
        <code>dark-mode</code> on the body element. When that class is added, 
        the CSS styles change the background and text colors. The 
        <code>classList.toggle()</code> method turns the class on and off 
        when the button is clicked. LocalStorage is used so the theme 
        preference stays saved after the page refreshes.
    </p>

    <h3>Python Visualization</h3>
    <p>
        The visualization uses matplotlib to create a bar chart from a 
        small dataset defined directly in the notebook. I understood how 
        the lists store the age groups and their values, and how 
        <code>plt.bar()</code> generates the chart. I modified the AI-generated 
        output by changing the title and adjusting the data values.

    <h2>My AI Usage Guidelines</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I will not submit AI-generated code that I do not understand.</li>
        <li>I will test and modify AI output instead of copying it exactly as given.</li>
        <li>I will treat AI as a collaborator, not a replacement for learning.</li>
        <li>I will document my prompts and clearly state when AI was used.</li>
        <li>I will make sure I can explain any code I submit to a peer.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Experiment A – Dark Mode Toggle</h2>
        <p>
            For this experiment, I used AI (Codex) to help generate a dark mode feature 
            for my portfolio site. The feature allows users to toggle between light and 
            dark themes using a button.

        <h2>Experiment B – Beginner Data Visualization</h2>
        <p>
            For this experiment, I used AI to generate starter Python code in Google Colab 
            to create a bar chart showing average social media hours by age group.
