          <h3>Overview of the Visualization</h3>
<p>
The visualization <em>Norway Returns 97% of Plastic Bottles</em> presents Norway’s plastic bottle return rate as a major environmental success. The graphic emphasizes the 97% statistic through a clean, minimal design that makes the information easy to understand at a glance. By focusing on a single, impressive number, the visualization quickly communicates its message and positions Norway as a leader in recycling efforts. While the design is visually effective and engaging, it also raises questions about how much context is provided behind that statistic.
