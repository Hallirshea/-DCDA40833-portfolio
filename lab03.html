  <h2>Critique</h2>

  <h3>Overview of the Visualization</h3>
  <p>
    For this lab, I chose the Norway plastic bottle return visualization from the
    <em>Beautiful News</em> section of Information Is Beautiful. When I first saw it,
    I immediately understood the main point. The design is very minimal and doesn’t
    use a lot of text, which makes the message clear right away: Norway returns a very
    high percentage of its plastic bottles.
  </p>

  <h3>Information Resolution</h3>
  <p>
    In terms of information resolution, I think the visualization is pretty low.
    It shows the outcome clearly, but it doesn’t provide much detail beyond that.
    There are no timelines, comparisons, or explanations built into the graphic.
    While there is a supporting article linked below the visualization, none of that
    information is actually included in the visual itself. Because of this, the
    graphic works more as a quick takeaway rather than a full explanation of the issue.
  </p>

  <h3>Effects Without Causes</h3>
  <p>
    One concern that stood out to me is effects without causes. The visualization shows
    that Norway has a very successful bottle return rate, but it doesn’t explain why
    this system works. Important factors like government policy, financial incentives,
    or infrastructure are completely left out, which makes the success feel almost
    effortless.
  </p>

  <h3>Rage to Conclude</h3>
  <p>
    I also think the visualization shows some rage to conclude. The design pushes the
    viewer toward a quick, positive conclusion without encouraging much deeper thought.
    While this fits the optimistic tone of <em>Beautiful News</em>, it also oversimplifies
    a more complex environmental issue. I think the visualization is visually appealing and easy to understand,
    but it sacrifices depth and context in order to keep the message simple and
    immediately impactful.
