            <p>Hi and welcome to my Lab Portfolio for DCDA 40833. This site showcases the work I've completed throughout the semester, demonstrating my growth in digital culture and data analytics. I hope to be able to look back and see all my progess within this course.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <!-- TODO: Replace this placeholder content with information about yourself -->
            <p><strong>Who I am:</strong> Hi! My name is Halli Shea, and I’m a senior at Texas Christian University majoring in Strategic Communication with a minor in Digital Culture and Data Analytics (DCDA). I’m especially interested in social media strategy, branding, and creative storytelling, and I enjoy working at the intersection of design, culture, and data. Through my classes and hands-on experience, I’ve worked on projects involving content creation, audience research, and data analysis, which has helped me build both creative and analytical skills. I’m excited to keep developing my experience in digital media and strategic communication as I prepare for future internships and a career in social media, marketing, or public relations.</p>
            <p><strong>My interests:</strong> I’m passionate about creativity and digital media, especially how people interact with content online. I was drawn to DCDA because it combines creativity with data, letting me understand not just what works on digital platforms, but why it works.</p>
            <p><strong>What I hope to learn:</strong> I hope to gain a deeper understanding of how data can be used to inform creative decisions and how digital tools can enhance storytelling in strategic communication.</p>
